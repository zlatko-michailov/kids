# Kids Repository

Copyright (c) Zlatko Michailov

This repository contains various (not necessarily related) projects whose 
purpose is to teach kids how to program.

Each project is implemented in JavaScript contained in a single HTML page.
This platform was chosen for its simplicity and self-sufficiency - 
no compilation is needed to run the programs.    

Key tenets in these projects are _simplicity_ and _cleanness_ of the code.
It is known that the UI is quite edgy.
The goal has been to show the code, not the UI, to young programmers. 

The projects from this repository are listed here in order of increased complexity:


## CodeBreaker.Sole

(Coming soon.)


## TicTacToe.Weak

[Try it now.](TicTacToe.Weak/TicTacToe.Weak.html)

This project implements the popular paper-and-pencil game.

There are some game limitations for the sake of simplicity: 
* The user always has the first move.
* The user always uses the "X" symbol.

As the name suggests, this program implements a weak algorithm -
it picks the first available cell probing the center first, then the corners,
and lastly the middles.
This weak algorithm was favored for its simplicity over the more complex 
_minimax_ algorithm which is implemented by [TicTacToe.Strong](#TicTacToe.Strong).
 
 
## TicTacToe.Strong

(Coming soon.)


## CodeBreaker.Compete

(Coming soon.)
